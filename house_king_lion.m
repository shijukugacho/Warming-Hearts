%% Main

% Create empty matrix
A = zeros(20);

% Iterate through rows
for i = 1:20
    % Iterate through columns
    for j = 1:20
        % Calculate the value at each iteration
        A(i,j) = ((i*j)+1)*j^2 + (i-1);
    end
end

% Setup plot
figure;
hold on;

% Create an array of colors
colors = ['g' 'y' 'b' 'm' 'c' 'k' 'r'];

% Iterate through each row
for i = 1:20
    % Plot the values for each row with a different color
    plot(A(i,:),'Color',colors(mod(i,7)+1));
end

% Label the plot
title('Warming Hearts');
xlabel('Time');
ylabel('Temperature');

%% Ending

% This code was written to demonstrate the power of MATLAB programming.
% Similarly, you can use MATLAB to solve complex problems in a concise
% manner. So, the next time you face a challenge, consider MATLAB!
